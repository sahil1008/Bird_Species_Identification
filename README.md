# Bird Species Classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This repository contains the code and resources for a deep learning project focused on classifying bird images based on their species using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm. The project utilizes a dataset of approximately 3000 bird images, categorized into 200 distinct classes.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to accurately classify bird images based on their unique features. By leveraging the power of deep learning and the KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Database) methodology, we aim to extract hidden knowledge and insights from raw data, enabling us to build a robust classification model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of around 3000 bird images, spanning across 200 different bird species. The images are carefully categorized and labeled, providing a rich source of training data for our CNN model. The dataset has been preprocessed using the KDD methodology to extract useful features and ensure optimal model performance.

## CNN Architecture

The CNN algorithm is designed with a 3-layer architecture, optimized for accurate bird species classification. The architecture includes the following layers:

1. **Convolutional Layer:** This layer applies multiple filters to the input image, extracting high-level features and patterns. By learning these filters, the model can identify important visual characteristics unique to each bird species.

2. **Pooling Layer:** The pooling layer reduces the spatial dimensions of the convolved features, decreasing the computational complexity and aiding in feature extraction. It helps retain the important features while discarding irrelevant information.

3. **Fully Connected Layer:** The fully connected layer connects all neurons from the previous layer to the output layer. This layer performs the final classification based on the learned features from the earlier layers.

## Training and Optimization

To train the CNN model, we employ the backpropagation algorithm in conjunction with gradient descent. The objective is to minimize the loss function, enabling the model to learn and improve its accuracy over time. During the training process, the model continuously adjusts its weights and biases to better classify bird images based on their species.

## Results

Upon completion, the CNN model achieves a high level of accuracy in classifying bird images based on their species. By leveraging the power of deep learning and the KDD methodology, we successfully extract and utilize hidden knowledge from the raw data, resulting in a robust classification model. The accuracy achieved demonstrates the effectiveness of the CNN architecture and the preprocessing techniques employed.
